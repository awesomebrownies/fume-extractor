## July 1st

I plan on this being a decorative project with a high level of functionality, modularity, and somethign easily packable. While looking around on the market, I've found little to no high quality fume extractors at an affordable price.

The decorative plan is to buy acrylic paints and cut outlines into paper as a stencil.

**3 hours:** research & model layout

## July 2nd

I'm planning to embed the 5v fan controller inside of the active carbon filter granule container. It needs to be at the end of the stage 2 filter to avoid clogging. I had to research how to do screw-in containers in onshape, so that's a new thing I've learned! This model is split into two parts, and I'll need to research more on the fan mounts to properly embed holes.

**2 hours:** modeling

## July 3rd

I spent a lot of time making planes and certain hard to get points and pieces to create all of the geometry. One of the difficulties was merging together all of the screw holes, and I had to refactor it later when I had messed up and created multiple parts for something that should only be one.

The overall outline shape is complete now. My plan is to have the top three cylinders as the active carbon backup containers when the volatile element sensor indicates required replacement. I've been brainstorming a spring mechanism for securing the vacuum hose to the extractor, and that's where I'll be heading next.

**6 hours:** modeling

## July 4th

Today I finished the 3d model. I'll be focusing on electronics going forward. The best approach I theorized for securing the vacuum hose was using springs for a friction fit that can be push released. You can see it in the image below.
