## July 1st

I plan on this being a decorative project with a high level of functionality, modularity, and somethign easily packable. While looking around on the market, I've found little to no high quality fume extractors at an affordable price.

The decorative plan is to buy acrylic paints and cut outlines into paper as a stencil.

**3 hours:** research & model layout

## July 2nd

I'm planning to embed the 5v fan controller inside of the active carbon filter granule container. It needs to be at the end of the stage 2 filter to avoid clogging. I had to research how to do screw-in containers in onshape, so that's a new thing I've learned! This model is split into two parts, and I'll need to research more on the fan mounts to properly embed holes.

**2 hours:** modeling
