# Fume Extractor

A Travel packable fume-extractor for electronic prototyping inspired by Rogue One movie props. 

***Why?*** Many soldering iron fume extractors are low quality and merely push away fumes rather than properly filter them. The capsule design ensures that all air moves through a thick layer of **active carbon granules**, not some cheap foam. In addition, the HEPA filter will deal with any particulates that could irritate the lungs.

## Key Features

It provides **3 spares** of quick-swap carbon capsules with HEPA filters to provide **2 stage filtering**. The microcontroller has an external mount with warning lights when **failed filtering of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)** is detected from a dedicated sensor. The vacuum tube is supported by a gooseneck arm for easily getting up close to fumes.

## How to Assemble

There are two parts to this.
* Ordering BOM
* 3d Printing Parts (check CAD folder)
* Putting it all together

Let's skip over to putting it together.

### Wiring up the PWM fans to the Microcontroller (Rpi-Pico)

Refer to the wiring diagram below:

### Putting together the print

The capsules are in a couple of pieces, and you'll need a screw and a nut for each of the parts.

* First, insert the fan inside, with the wires on the accessible side for hooking up to the microcontroller. Use the screws available inside of the package for the fans
* Then, put a mesh between the fan and the rest of the capsule on the next part. You'll need two M2 screws and nuts
* Finally, pour the bag of carbon granules inside, and insert the HEPA filter at the end. As before, you'll need two M2 screws and nuts

### Final Steps

* Flashing firmware

To flash the firmware, open up the Arduino IDE, and copy and paste the code from the repository to the pico
