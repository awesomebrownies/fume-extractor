# Fume Extractor

A Travel packable fume-extractor for electronic prototyping inspired by Rogue One movie props. 

***Why?*** Many soldering iron fume extractors are low quality and merely push away fumes rather than properly filter them. The capsule design ensures that all air moves through a thick layer of **active carbon granules**, not some cheap foam. In addition, the HEPA filter will deal with any particulates that could irritate the lungs.

## Key Features

It provides **3 spares** of quick-swap carbon capsules with HEPA filters to provide **2 stage filtering**. The microcontroller has an external mount with warning lights when **failed filtering of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)** is detected from a dedicated sensor. The vacuum tube is supported by a gooseneck arm for easily getting up close to fumes.
